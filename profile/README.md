    <!-- <strong>Bangkit Capstone Project</strong> <br> -->
    Solving the need for manufacturing companies to have highly customizable and scalable systems and sensors for object detection. 
  </p>

# Introduction
The objective is to develop a new mobile app that meets the needs of our client within a specified timeline and the needs of the manufacturing companies for a highly customizable and scalable system for object detection. Our plan of approach is to create an Android-based application equipped with machine learning/computer vision features that can be used as systems and sensors for object detection.

# How it Works?
Utilizing OpenCV modules to integrate with Android Application and will make use of the Camera feature from Android to capture the video stream and let it get processed by the OpenCV script in order to count the moving objects.
